The main aim of this project is to create a system where a screen equipped with a camera allows users to not only view themselves but also see overlays of their underlying muscular systems.â€‹
These overlays should accurately mimic movements, reflecting changes as the user moves.
Additionally, the system should be capable of depicting the muscular system of multiple individuals simultaneously if they are in front of the screen.
Furthermore, it must accurately differentiate between humans and other objects, such as cats or dogs, showing no results for non human entities
